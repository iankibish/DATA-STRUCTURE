. Linear Data Structures
1. Arrays
Where Applied

Image processing systems (pixel grids)

Scientific computing libraries like NumPy

Database record storage

Game development (grid-based maps)

Why Arrays Are Used

O(1) fast indexing – Direct access using index

Memory efficiency – Stored in contiguous memory

CPU cache-friendly – Improves performance

Best for fixed-size data collections

Real Example

In Adobe Photoshop, images are stored as large 2D arrays of pixels.

2. Linked Lists
Where Applied

Music playlists

Browser navigation

Memory management in operating systems

Why Linked Lists Are Used

Dynamic size – No fixed memory limit

Efficient insertion and deletion

Does not require contiguous memory

Real Example

Used in process scheduling within Linux for dynamic task handling.

3. Stacks
Where Applied

Function call management (Call Stack)

Undo/Redo systems

Expression evaluation (compilers)

Why Stacks Are Used

LIFO (Last In First Out) behavior

Natural fit for recursion

Easy reversal of operations

Real Example

Undo feature in Microsoft Word uses a stack to reverse actions.

4. Queues
Where Applied

CPU task scheduling

Printer spooling systems

Network packet handling

Message brokers

Why Queues Are Used

FIFO (First In First Out) fairness

Efficient task ordering

Prevents starvation in systems

Real Example

Distributed streaming platform Apache Kafka uses queue-like logs for message ordering.

2. Non-Linear Data Structures
5. Trees
Where Applied

File systems

Databases indexing

XML/HTML DOM structure

Artificial Intelligence (decision trees)

Why Trees Are Used

Represent hierarchical relationships

Fast searching and sorting (O(log n))

Efficient indexing with B-Trees

Real Examples

MySQL uses B-Trees for indexing.

File systems in Windows use tree structures for directories.

6. Graphs
Where Applied

Social networks

GPS navigation

Network routing

Recommendation systems

Why Graphs Are Used

Represent complex relationships

Support shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra)

Efficient modeling of connected systems

Real Examples

Google Maps uses graphs for route calculation.

Facebook models friendships as graph connections.

7. Hash Tables
Where Applied

Caching systems

Database indexing

Password storage systems

Dictionaries in programming languages

Why Hash Tables Are Used

O(1) average lookup time

Efficient key-value storage

Fast search, insert, delete operations

Real Example

Redis uses hash tables for ultra-fast data retrieval.

3. Advanced Data Structures
8. Heaps (Priority Queues)
Where Applied

CPU scheduling

Task management systems

Pathfinding algorithms

AI systems

Why Heaps Are Used

Efficient priority management

O(log n) insertion and deletion

Always retrieves highest/lowest priority element

Real Example

Used in shortest path algorithms inside Google Maps.

9. Tries (Prefix Trees)
Where Applied

Autocomplete systems

Spell checkers

Search engines

Why Tries Are Used

Fast prefix searching

Efficient word storage

Reduces duplicate comparisons

Real Example

Search suggestions in Google Search use trie-like structures.

4. How Data Structures Work Within Systems
System	Data Structure Used	Why
Operating System	Queue, Stack, Tree	Process scheduling, memory management
Database	B-Tree, Hash Table	Fast indexing and searching
Web Browser	Stack, Tree, Hash Table	Navigation, DOM rendering, caching
Social Media	Graph	Relationship modeling
E-commerce	Hash Table, Tree	Fast product search
Key Reasons Data Structures Are Chosen

Performance Efficiency – Faster execution time

Memory Optimization – Better space management

Scalability – Handle millions of users/data

Problem-Specific Design – Each structure solves a specific problem efficiently

Conclusion

Data structures are applied based on:

Nature of the problem (hierarchical, linear, relational)

Required speed (search, insert, delete)

Memory constraints

System scalability requirements

They are the backbone of:

Operating systems

Databases

Web applications

AI systems

Networking platforms
